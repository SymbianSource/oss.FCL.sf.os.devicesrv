Steps to test HWRM
------------------------------
- Change to \sf\os\devicesrv\resourcemgmt\hwresourcesmgr\test\group directory
- Build test code by executing 'sbs -c armv5.test' (for armv5 target)
- Include te_hwrm.iby file in the rom build by adding the following line in 
	SymbianOS.iby (one such file which is included in rom building)
	
	#include <te_hwrm.iby>
	
Note: There are certain test specific cenrep files that we export from within 
			this test code. They might get overridden on certain platforms such as 
			platsim by the crml files export as part of production code. They should 
			be removed by manually deletion. List of those crml	files is as follows:
				
				Exported from \sf\os\devicesrv\resourcemgmt\hwresourcesmgrconfig\conf
				1. hwresourcesandenhancements_10200C8B.crml
				2. hwresourcesandenhancements_10200C8C.crml
				3. hwresourcesandenhancements_10200C8D.crml
				4. hwresourcesandenhancements_10205043.crml
				
				Exported from \sf\os\devicesrv\resourceinterfaces\fmtransmittercontrol\conf
				5. hwresourceclientfmtx_20008EA6.crml
				
Command to run HWRM tests
------------------------------
- After booting the built rom image, switch to eshell
- For the TEF tests, run the command
	testexecute z:\testdata\scripts\te_hwrm.script
			
- There are additional RTests, run the command
	hwrmtests.exe
