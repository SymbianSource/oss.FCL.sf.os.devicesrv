The envsetup.cmd and envrecall.cmd scripts are by default meant for ARMV5 and WINSCW platforms only.
If the armv5 variant needs to be handled, the variant name should be passed as parameter to envsetup.cmd
and envrecall.cmd scripts.

For example:
If testing only on winscw
use envsetup.cmd (to clean the production executables and setup stubs)
(and envrecall.cmd to revert to stub free state)

If testing for platsim
use envsetup.cmd platsim79 (this would build for armv5.platsim79 apart from armv5 and winscw)
