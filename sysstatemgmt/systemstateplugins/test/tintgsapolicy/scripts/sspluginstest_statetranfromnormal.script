//! @SYMTestCaseDesc				Checks for state transitions to fail and shutdown states from normal state 
//! 						under different scenarios.
//! @SYMTestType				CIT	
//! @SYMTestPriority				Critical
//! @SYMTestActions				Test checks the results for request state transition under different scenarios:
//! 						1. Normal state to Fail state.
//! 						Scenario 1 - Request for state change from Normal to invalid state 
//! 						Scenario 2 - Request for state change from Normal to fail state with invalid substate 
//! 						Scenario 3 - Request for two state changes(1. fail state 2. shutdown state) one after the other without waiting 
//! 						Scenario 4 - Request for two state changes one after the other without waiting for the first one to complete
//! 						Once first and second request are completed the system will be in fail state, now issue another state transition
//! 						request to fail state again.	
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 			1. Normal state to Fail state.
//! 						Scenario 1 - Request will be completed with KErrNotSupported
//! 						Scenario 2 - Request will be completed with KErrNotSupported
//! 						Scenario 3 - First request to the fail state will be completed with KErrCancel 
//! 						Second request to transit to the shutdown state will be completed with KErrNotSupported.
//! 						Scenario 4 - The first request to the fail state will be completed with KErrCancel 
//! 						Second request to transit to the fail state will be completed with KErrNone.
//! 						Third request to transit to the fail state will be completed with KErrNotSupported.
