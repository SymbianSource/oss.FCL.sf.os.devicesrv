//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSMA-SSM-0009

//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		Check behaviour of state policy resolver class CSsmSwpTransitionScheduler.
//! @SYMTestType		UT	
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestCaseDependencies	none
//! @SYMTestActions		The test will perform calls to the different methods of the CSsmSwpTransitionScheduler class in different scenarios. 
//! 				1.Call NewL(), both under normal and OOM conditions.
//! 				2.Call SubmitL(), both under normal and OOM conditions.
//! 				3.Submit a simple swp request and check all expected calls were made.
//! 				4.Submit multiple swp requests, including some invalid ones, and check all expected calls were made.
//! 				5.Submit multiple swp requests, calling DoCancel() at different stages.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Expected results are:
//! 				1 & 2.  When the methods are tested under OOM conditions, intermediate iterations finish with KErrNoMemory, with successful one completing with KErrNone. Memory is not leaked in any iteration.
//! 				3.All calls made as expected. Swp value updated accordingly.
//! 				4.All calls made as expected. Swp values updated accordingly, and those invalid failed. 
//! 				5.All calls made as expected. All transitions after DoCancel() are not completed and the values for the swp keys are not updated.
