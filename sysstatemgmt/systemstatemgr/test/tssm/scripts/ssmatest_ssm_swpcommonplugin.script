//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSMA-SSM-0015
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//! @SYMREQ			REQ9122
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		Check that same plug-in dll can be shared with a number of different Swp.
//! 				Check that a multiple swp changes can be requested / queued / cancelled.
//! @SYMTestType		CIT	
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestCaseDependencies	See tssm_swppolicy_common.cpp file
//! @SYMTestActions		The test will define a very simple swp plug-in dll which will just consist on one single command to publish the swp.
//! 				Few Swp will be mapped to this single plug-in in order to request changes in their values. Different scenarios will be covered in this test:
//! 				1.Single Swp change to a single Swp key using same session.
//! 				2.Single Swp change to different Swp keys using same session.
//! 				3.Multiple Swp changes to different Swp keys using different sessions.
//! 				4.Multiple Swp changes to different Swp keys using different sessions, and then cancel the requests on the running session.
//! 				5.Multiple Swp changes to different Swp keys using different sessions, and then cancel the requests on the queued session.
//! 				6.Stress testing. Request lots of swp changes consecutively.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	All Swp are updated accordingly, regardless of the session where they are updated from. Where cancellation occurs, 
//! 					KErrCancel is returned for the requests on that session, while other requests continue as normal.
