START_TESTCASE 			DEVSRVS-SSMA-SSM-0012
//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSMA-SSM-0012
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		Check the SSM validation of command lists works as expected. 
//! @SYMTestType		CIT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestCaseDependencies	See tssm_swppolicy_invalidlist.cpp file
//! @SYMTestActions		The test will prepare several Static Command List resource files associated to a test state policy. The test then will request a state transition, each one associated to a different command list, when
//! 				1.The command list does not contain a 'Publish Swp' command.
//! 				2.The command list contains more than one 'Publish Swp' command.
//! 				3.The command list contains a 'Publish State' command.
//! 				4.The command list contains one or more EDeferredWaitForStart but no MULTIPLE_WAIT command
//! 				5.The command list contains one or more MULTIPLE_WAIT but no command with EDeferredWaitForStart. The list includes a known erroneous command, with severity not ESsmIgnoreOnFailure.
//! 				6.The command list leaves on preparation
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Expected results are:
//! 				1.Panic with EInvalidCommandList
//! 				2.Panic with EInvalidCommandList
//! 				3.Panic with EInvalidCommandList
//! 				4.Panic with EMissingMultipleWaitCommand
//! 				5.The list is valid, so it must execute correctly, however, the erroneous command halts its execution and the error is returned back to the policy.
//! 				6.Panic with the value defined in SsmSwpTransitionEngine::RunError()
