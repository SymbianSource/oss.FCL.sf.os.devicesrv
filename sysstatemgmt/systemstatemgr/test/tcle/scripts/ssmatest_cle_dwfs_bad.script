//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSMA-CLE-0008
//!  @SYMTestCaseDesc		Execution erroneous commands with EDeferredWaitForStart.
//!  @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//!  @SYMREQ			REQ9136 REQ9140 REQ9141 REQ9153
//!  @SYMTestType		CIT
//!  @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//!  @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//!  @SYMTestActions		The test will prepare a valid command list that will launch test applications and custom commands with EDeferredWaitForStart. 
//!  				The test will ensure that some commands fail to execute (erroneous rendezvous leaves panics timeouts non-existent path …).
//!  				The command list will include commands which will be:
//!  				1. Using SSM_START_APP_INFO.
//!  				2. Using SSM_START_PROCESS_INFO.
//!  				3. Using SSM_START_CUSTOM_COMMAND.
//!  @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Ensure ssma executes EDeferredWaitForStart commands until a SSM_MULTIPLE_WAIT is found. 
//!  				Ensure ssma ignores any possible error if severity is EIgnoreFailure for the SSM_MULTIPLE_WAIT.
//!  					(In any other case ensure that ssma does not execute any further command after the SSM_MULTIPLE_WAIT and that the severity
//!  					of the first EDeferredWaitForStart command that failed is reported back)
//!  					{This was decided at some point. May have changed by the time you read this…}
