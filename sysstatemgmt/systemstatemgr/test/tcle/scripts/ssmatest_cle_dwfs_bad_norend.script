//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		Execution commands with EDeferredWaitForStart that don’t rendezvous.
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//! @SYMREQ			REQ9136 REQ9140 REQ9141 REQ9153
//! @SYMTestType		CIT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//! @SYMTestActions		The test will prepare a valid command list that will launch test applications and custom commands with EDeferredWaitForStart. 
//! 				The test will ensure that some commands fail to rendezvous when a SSM_MULTIPLE_WAIT (with a severity different to EIgnoreFailure ) command is found. 
//! 				The command list will include commands which will be:
//! 				1.Using SSM_START_APP_INFO.
//! 				2.Using SSM_START_PROCESS_INFO.
//! 				3.Using SSM_START_CUSTOM_COMMAND.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Ensure ssma executes EDeferredWaitForStart commands until a SSM_MULTIPLE_WAIT is found. 
//! 					(Ensure that ssma is aware of ALL the commands that have not rendezvoused for the SSM_MULTIPLE_WAIT timeout and that the severity
//! 					of the one with highest severity amongst them is reported back to the CLE.)
//! 					{This was decided at some point. May have changed by the time you read this…}
