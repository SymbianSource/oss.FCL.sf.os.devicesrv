//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSMA-CMN-0007
//!  @SYMPREQ 			DEF119566
//!  @SYMTestType			UT
//!  @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//!  @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//!  @SYMTestCaseDesc		Check behaviour of swp aware session classes  RSsmSystemWideProperty & CSsmSystemWideProperty
//!  @SYMTestActions		The test will perform calls to the different methods of the both SsmSystemWideProperty classes in different scenarios.
//! 				For RSsmSystemWideProperty:
//! 					1.Call Connect()  using an invalid system wide property.
//! 					2.Call GetValue() without having connected 
//! 					3.Call Subscribe() and SubscribeCancel() without having connected
//! 					4.Setup a RSsmSystemWideProperty define a RProperty Publish a value & Read the RSsmSystemWideProperty and assert that it got the correct value
//!					For CSsmSystemWideProperty:
//! 					5.Check OOM conditions for all leaving functions 
//! 					6.Add subscribers using AddSubscriberL(). Check that upon notification NotifySubscribers() perfoms appropriate action. 
//! 					7.Delete some of the subscribers using RemoveSubscriber(). Check that upon notification NotifySubscribers() performs appropriate action. 
//!  @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Following results are expected:
//! 					1.Operation will still succeed no error is reported. Client can still subscribe but KErrPending is returned and the request does not complete (until property is defined)
//! 					2.KErrBadHandle 
//! 					3.Subscribe completes with KErrBadHandle. Cancel does nothing.
//! 					4.Value set in RProperty can be read using RSsmSystemWideProperty.
//! 					5.All allocated memory should be cleaned up either by the CleanupStack or by a destructor.
//! 					6.Added subscribers are notified appropriately
//! 					7.The subscribers are notified appropriately except for those that were removed.
