//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSMA-STARTSAFE-0010
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//! @SYMTestType		UT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		To ensure that the test app will be terminated if it exceeds the timeout
//! 					specified in the ssmstartupproperties.
//! @SYMTestActions		1.Start a slow test application synchronously using fire-and-forget with timeout
//! 					less than the time required for the application to start and 1 retry.
//! 				2.Start a slow test application synchronously using fire-and-forget with timeout
//! 					less than the time required for the application to start and without retries.
//! 				3.Start a slow test application synchronously using fire-and-forget with timeout
//! 					more than the time required for the application to start and without retries.
//! 				4.Start a test application synchronously using fire-and-forget with timeout
//! 					more than the time required for the application to start and with retries.
//! 				5.Start a test application which fails to start synchronously using fire-and-forget 
//! 					without timeout and 1 retry.
//! 				6.Start a test application which fails to start synchronously using fire-and-forget 
//! 					after 2 retries due to time out with 2 retries remaining.
//! 				7.Start a test application which fails to start twice and starts on the 3rd retry 
//! 					synchronously using fire-and-forget without timeout and 3 retries.
//! 				The number of process and thread handles before and after all the tests will be checked.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults	1.SsmStartSafe supplies error code KErrTimedOut even after retry. 
//! 					No running instances of the test-app are found.
//! 				2.SsmStartSafe supplies error code KErrTimedOut. 
//! 					No running instances of the test-app are found.
//! 				3.SsmStartSafe starts the test app. One instance of the running app is found and killed
//! 				4.SsmStartSafe starts the test app after 2 retries. One instance of the running app is found and killed
//! 				5.SsmStartSafe supplies error code returned from the test app. 
//! 					No running instances of the test-app are found.
//! 				6.SsmStartSafe supplies error code returned from the test app. 
//! 					No running instances of the test-app are found. 	
//! 				7.SsmStartSafe starts the test app after 2 retries.  One instance of the running app is found and killed
//!				The number of process and thread handles before and after all the tests should be the same.
