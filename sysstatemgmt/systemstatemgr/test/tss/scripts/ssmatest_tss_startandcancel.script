//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSMA-STARTSAFE-0007
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//! @SYMTestType		UT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		To ensure that asynchronous calls to Start can be cancelled.
//! @SYMTestActions		Start a slow test app and cancel.
//! 					1.Start an instance of the slow test-app asynchronously as a process. Cancel the call.
//! 					2.Start an instance of the slow test-app asynchronously as an app. Cancel the call.
//! 					3.Start four instances of test-app-no-rv. Two as processes and two as apps. Delete the instance of SsmStartSafe.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Supplied completion codes should be as anticipated. Instances of the app should be found.
//! 					1.SsmStartSafe should supply KErrCancel. The running test app should be found.
//! 					2.SsmStartSafe should supply KErrCancel. The running test app should be found.
//! 					3.SsmStartSafe should supply KErrCancel in each case. Four instances of the badly behaved app should be found (and killed). Start should not leave.
