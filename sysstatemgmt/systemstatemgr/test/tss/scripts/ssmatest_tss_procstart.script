//! @SYMTestCaseID		DEVSRVS-SSMA-STARTSAFE-0002
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//! @SYMTestType		UT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		1.To ensure that the test app can be started successfully as a process.
//! 				2.Ensure that a call to start and monitor an already started and monitored process, returns KErrAlreadyExists.
//! @SYMTestActions		1.a Start a test app asynchronously as a process using fire-and-forget
//! 				1.b Start a test app asynchronously as a process using wait-for-start
//! 				1.c Start a test app synchronously as a process using fire-and-forget
//! 				1.d Start a test app synchronously as a process using wait-for-start
//! 				1.e.Attempt to start a test-server twice 
//! 				2. Start and monitor a process. Try to start and monitor already started and monitored process. 
//! 					Start and monitor would return KErrAlreadyExists and second process will not be started. 
//! 					Kill the process created first. Wait the throttle time. Ensure the process is restarted. 
//! 					Tell it to stop being monitored. Kill it finally and ensure it is not restarted.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Test app process should be found and killed.
//! 					1.a One instance of the test app process should be found and killed
//! 					1.b The test app should rendezvous with KErrNone.One instance of the test app process should be found and killed
//! 					1.c One instance of the test app process should be found and killed
//! 					1.d The test app should rendezvous with KErrNone. One instance of the test app process should be found and killed
//! 					1.e Only one running instance should be found
//! 				2. Trying to start a Process which is already started and monitored will return KErrAlreadyExists. 
//! 					And already monitored process continues to be monitored. It is restarted when first killed, but not when told to stop its monitoring.
