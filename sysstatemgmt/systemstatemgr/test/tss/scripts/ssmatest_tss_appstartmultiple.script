//! @SYMTestActions			1.Start 4 instances of test-app-good as apps. Do not supply a timeout value
//!  					2.Start 4 instances of test-app-good as apps supplying a timeout value
//!  					3.Start 4 instances of test-app-no-rv supplying a timeout value.
//!  					4.Start 3 instances of test-app-good and one of test-app-rv-after-retry.
