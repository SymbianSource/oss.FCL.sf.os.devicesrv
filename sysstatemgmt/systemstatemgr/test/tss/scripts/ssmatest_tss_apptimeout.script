//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSMA-STARTSAFE-0005
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//! @SYMTestType		UT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		Applications start but time-out. Anticipated error codes are supplied.
//! @SYMTestActions		Start the slow Test App as an application and as a process .
//! 					1.Start an instance of test-app-slow as an app allowing insufficient time for it to rendezvous.
//! 					2.Start an instance of test-app-slow as a process allowing insufficient time for it to rendezvous.
//! 					3.Start a slow test application asynchronously using wait-for-signal with timeout
//! 					less than the time required for the application to start and 1 retry.
//! 					4.Start a slow test application asynchronously using wait-for-signal with timeout
//! 					less than the time required for the application to start and without retries.
//! 					5.Start a slow test application asynchronously using wait-for-signal with timeout
//! 					more than the time required for the application to start and without retries.
//! 					6.Start a test application asynchronously using wait-for-signal with timeout
//! 					more than the time required for the application to start and with retries.
//! 					7.Start a test application which fails to start asynchronously using wait-for-signal 
//! 					without timeout and 1 retry.
//! 					8.Start a test application which fails to start twice and starts on the 3rd retry 
//! 					asynchronously using wait-for-signal without timeout and 3 retries.		
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	The tests induce a timeout in each case.
//! 					1.SsmStartSafe supplies error code KErrTimedOut. No running instances of the test-app are found
//! 					2.SsmStartSafe supplies error code KErrTimedOut. No running instances of the test-app are found.
//! 					3.SsmStartSafe supplies error code KErrTimedOut even after retry. 
//! 					No running instances of the test-app are found.
//! 					4.SsmStartSafe supplies error code KErrTimedOut. 
//! 					No running instances of the test-app are found.
//! 					5.SsmStartSafe starts the test app. One instance of the running app is found and killed
//! 					6.SsmStartSafe starts the test app after 2 retries. One instance of the running app is found and killed
//! 					7.SsmStartSafe supplies error code returned from the test app. 
//! 					No running instances of the test-app are found.
//!					8.SsmStartSafe starts the test app after 2 retries.  One instance of the running app is found and killed
