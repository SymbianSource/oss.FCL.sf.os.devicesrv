//!   					3.Start a test application synchronously using fire-and-forget
//!   					4.Start a test application synchronously using wait-for-start
//!   					5.Start two instances of a test application synchronously using wait-for-start. 
//!   					6.Start the recalcitrant test-app specifying several retries.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	Names should match and be output to the log
//! 					1.One instance of the test app is found and killed
