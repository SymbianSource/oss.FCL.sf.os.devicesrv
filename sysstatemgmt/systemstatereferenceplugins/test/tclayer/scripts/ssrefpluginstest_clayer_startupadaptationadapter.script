//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		Check behaviour of State adaptation class.
//! 				Check behaviour of SIM adaptation class.
//! 				Check behaviour of RTC adaptation class.
//! 				Check behaviour of emergency call RF adaptation class.
//! 				Check behaviour of misc adaptation class.
//! 				Check behaviour of concurrent requests on adaptation classes.
//! 				Check behaviour of on demand adaptation loading.
//! 				Check behaviour of creation and destruction of adaptation classes
//! 				Check behaviour of mulitple requests.
//! @SYMTestActions		doTestStateAdaptationL() Tests that each method in the state adaptation class forwards requests to and from
//! 					the startup adaptation wrapper correctly.
//! 				doTestSimAdaptationL() Tests that each method in the SIM adaptation class forwards requests to and from
//! 					the startup adaptation wrapper correctly.
//! 				doTestRtcAdaptationL() Tests that each method in the RTC adaptation class forwards requests to and from
//! 					the startup adaptation wrapper correctly.
//! 				doTestEmergencyCallRfAdaptationL() Tests that each method in the emergency call RF adaptation class forwards requests to and from
//! 					the startup adaptation wrapper correctly.
//! 				doTestMiscAdaptationL() Tests that each method in the misc adaptation class forwards requests to and from
//! 					the startup adaptation wrapper correctly.
//! 				doTestConcurrentRequestsL() Tests that concurrent requests to the startup adaptation adapter are queued
//! 					by the startup adaptation wrapper correctly. 
//! 				doTestOnDemandL() Tests that the startup adaptation adapter only loads the
//! 					startup adaptation on demand.
//! 				doTestCreationAndDestructionL() Tests that the exported functions create the adaptation classes correctly
//!  					and then tests destruction by destroying the adaptation adapter.
//!  				doTestMultipleRequestsL() Tests that the startup adaptation adapter doesn't dispatch multiple requests.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	All methods handle the object data appropriately, with no errors reported and the
//! 					startup adaptation wrapper having appropriate methods called.
//! 				All methods handle the object data appropriately, with no errors reported and the
//! 					startup adaptation wrapper having appropriate methods called.
//! 				All methods handle the object data appropriately, with no errors reported and the

//! 				All methods handle the object data appropriately, with no errors reported and the
//! 					startup adaptation wrapper having appropriate methods called.
//! 				The startup adaptation is only loaded when a request is made which needs it.
//! 				The classes are created and destroyed with no memory leaks.
//! 				The startup adaptation is only loaded when a request is made which needs it.
