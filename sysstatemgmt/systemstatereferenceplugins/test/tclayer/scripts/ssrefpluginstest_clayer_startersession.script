//! @SYMTestCaseID 		DEVSRVS-SSREFPLUGINS-CLAYER-0001
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1871
//! @SYMREQ			REQ9152
//! @SYMTestType			UT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		Check basic behaviour of RStarterSession class.
//! 				Check set state functionality of RStarterSession class.
//! 				Check reset behaviour of RStarterSession class.
//! 				Check shutdown behaviour of RStarterSession class.
//! 				Check reset network behaviour of RStarterSession class.
//! 				Check RTC validity behaviour of RStarterSession class.
//! 				Check RF for emergency call behaviour of RStarterSession class.
//! 				Check ending splash screen behaviour of RStarterSession class.
//! @SYMTestActions		doTestConnectAndClose() The test performs basic operations on a RStarterSession object, namely calling the following methods:
//!					1.Constructors and checks close operations work on a closed object.
//!					2.Attempts to connect when an error, KErrNotFound, is returned. 
//!					3.Attempts to connect when no error is returned.
//!					4.Attempts to close the connected object.
//!				doTestSetState() The test calls the different possible states on a connected RStarterSession via RStarterSession::SetState():
//!					1.ENormal
//!					2.EAlarm 
//!					3.ECharging
//!					4.EOffline
//!					5.EBTSap
//!					6.-1, this is an invalid value and should return an error.
//!					7.  ENormal with RSsmStateManager::RequestStateChange() returning an error
//!				doTestRequestReset() The test attempts to call three different reset reasons on a connected RStarterSession via RStarterSession::Reset().
//!				doTestRequestShutdown() The test attempts to call RStarterSession::Shutdown().
//!				doTestRequestResetNetwork() The test attempts to call RStarterSession::ResetNetwork().
//!				doTestIsRTCValid() The test attempts to call RStarterSession::IsRTCTimeValid() in the following situations:
//!				 	1.  The RSsmRtcAdaptation test wrapper fails to connect
//!				 	2.  The RSsmRtcAdaptation test wrapper returns true validity
//!				 	3.  The RSsmRtcAdaptation test wrapper returns false validity
//! 					4.  The RSsmRtcAdaptation test wrapper fails with KErrNotSupported
//! 				doTestRfForEmergencyCall() The test attempts to call RStarterSession::ActivateRfForEmergencyCall() and RStarterSession::DeactivateRfForEmergencyCall() in the following situations:
//!					1.  The RSsmEmergencyCallRfAdaptation fails to connect, returning the connection failure error
//!					2.  The RSsmEmergencyCallRfAdaptation (de)activation request succeeds.
//! 					3.  The RSsmEmergencyCallRfAdaptation (de)activation request fails with KErrNotSupported, returning the error from the call
//! 				doTestEndSplashScreen() The test attempts to call RStarterSession::EndSplashScreen to end the splash screen.
//! 					1. RProperty::Attach() fails with KErrNotFound.
//! 					2. Successful setting of the value.  
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	All methods handle the object data appropriately, with no errors reported and the
//! 					RSsmStateManager wrapper having appropriate methods called.
//! 				All methods handle the object data appropriately, with only and error on the invalid value and the
//! 					RSsmStateManager wrapper having appropriate methods called on non error values.
//! 				All methods handle the object data appropriately, with no errors reported and the
//! 					RSsmStateManager wrapper having appropriate methods called.
//! 				All methods handle the object data appropriately, with no errors reported and the
//!  					RSsmStateManager wrapper having appropriate methods called. 		
//!  				All methods handle the object data appropriately, with no errors reported and the
//! 					RSsmStateManager wrapper having appropriate methods called.
//! 				All calls to IsRTCTimeValide() handle the object data appropriately, always returning a valid boolean
//! 					and the	RSsmRtcAdaptation wrapper having appropriate methods called.
//! 				All methods handle the object data appropriately, with errors reported as noted and the
//! 					RSsmEmergencyCallRfAdaptation wrapper having appropriate methods called.
//! 				All methods handle the object data appropriately and the RProperty wrapper has
//! 					appropriate methods called.
