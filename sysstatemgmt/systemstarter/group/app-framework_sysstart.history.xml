    <description>System does not restart when SYSLIBS_TEST is defined, hence removed checking for restart when this is defined.</description>

    System Starter Framework.

  <minorchange revision="004">
    Generalise sysstartconfig.iby to allow the mode to be specified via &quot;#define _STARTUPMODE xxx&quot; - the older &quot;#define _STARTUPMODEn&quot; macros are still supported. This file is now useful for any ROM image which supports a single startup mode - it is therefore unlikely to be useful in production devices which typically need multiple strtup modes.
  </minorchange>
  <minorchange revision="003">
    Provide a generic sysstartconfig.iby file and resource files for startup mode 1 (Text shell), to enable sysstart to be used in ROMs without UI-layer code. These files were previously owned by the Techview startup component.

  <defect number="PDEF099099" title="UIF TestFramework component has source dependancy on SysStart" revision="001">
    Rename sysstart\test\resource\hardware\SSCForStartupMode3_target.rss to SSCForStartupMode0_target.rss to reflect more accurately the real mode the tests use for startup mechanism.
