//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ1089
//! @SYMTestType		UT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		SysStart can initiate process monitoring.
//! @SYMTestActions		Create a SSC file which will contain an item for TestProcess with EStartupProcess2, EWaitForStart, EIgnoreProcessFailure
//! 				and monitor = 1. 
//! 				SysStart should load Test-process passing the command-line parameter "-server" in order for it to start as a simple server
//! 				and initiate monitoring for this process. 
//! 				The test then establishes that it has been started as we expect. 
//! 				The test then kills the process, waits for the throttle time and establishes that it has been restarted.
//! 				After which the server is instructed to cancel monitoring. the preocess is then killed.
//! 				After the throttle time we establish that the process has not been restarted.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults A running process of that name is not found after being restarted and killed again (when monitoring has been cancelled)
