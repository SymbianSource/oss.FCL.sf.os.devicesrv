//! @SYMTestCaseDesc		Check if AMA can be started using AmaStarter DLL.
//! 				Check if AMA can be started using LoadAmaStart DLL.
//! 				Check for Handle leaks in CAmaStart::StartL().
//! @SYMPREQ 			PREQ871
//! @SYMREQ			REQ9141
//! @SYMTestType		UT
//! @SYMTestPriority		Critical
//! @SYMTestStatus 		Implemented
//! @SYMTestCaseDependencies	The appropriate database has been created.
//! @SYMTestActions			TestCase1L() The test uses a known DSC store database with valid items in it.
//! 					Then the test uses CAmaStart::StartL() with the appropriate item id to start these AMAs
//! 					from an existing DSC item in the created test database.
//! 				TestCase2L() The test uses a known DSC store database with valid items in it.
//! 					Then the test uses CLoadAmaStart::StartL() with the appropriate item id to start these AMAs
//! 					from an existing DSC item in the created test database.
//! 				TestCase3L() The test uses a known DSC store database with valid items in it.
//! 					Then the test uses CAmaStart::StartL() with the appropriate item id to start these AMAs
//! 					from an existing DSC item in the created test database. The test case checks
//! 					for the no. of open handles in the process owning this thread and the
//! 					no. of open handles in this thread.
//! @SYMTestExpectedResults 	The different AMAs are started as expected from the test database.
//! 					The application logs are read to check the applications were launched as expected.
//! 				The different AMAs are started as expected from the test database.
//! 					The application logs are read to check the applications were launched as expected.
//! 				The no. of open handles in process owning this thread and no. of open handles in this thread should
//! 					be same before calling CAmaStart::StartL() and after destroying CAmaStart object.
